## Description 
**Harmony** is a configuration tool designed to simplify the management of system and user environment variables needed for the process of development. By allowing you to declaratively describe these variables in a specific configuration file, Harmony automates the setup process, saving you time and reducing the chance of errors.

---

## Purpose üí≠
The primary goal of Harmony is to streamline the configuration process and avoid the repetitive, time-consuming task of manually copying and pasting environment variables. This can significantly slow down work in production environments and lead to frustration, which Harmony aims to eliminate.

## How to Use üë©‚Äçüè´

1. **Clone or Download**:  
   - Clone the repository or download the `config.hm.json` template along with the `harmony.exe` executable.
   

2. **Configure the Environment Variables**:  
   - The configuration file follows a simple **key: value** structure.  
     - **Key**: The name of the environment variable.  
     - **Value**: The path, settings, or link associated with the variable.

3. **Save the Configuration**:  
   - After editing the configuration file, save it.

4. **Run the Executable**:  
   - Execute the `harmony.exe` file.
   - When prompted, enter the path to your configuration file.

5. **Execute the Configuration**:  
   - Press Enter to proceed. Harmony will automatically apply the environment variables based on the configuration file in just a few seconds.
   - **for windows make sure to run it as an administrator or it wont work**
